# Introduction to Embedded Systems Lab 4
Lab 4 of this class goes over how to use interrupts timers and PWN pins on the MSP430 board.

# Question 1
In this question, a program was coded that uses an interrupt timer to make an LED blink at 250ms.

# Question 2
In this question, a program was coded using the polling process to output a PWM signal using the built in ACLK hardware. The signal was them plotted using an osiliscope.

# Question 3
In this question, a program was coded using the polling process to generate a PWM signal and change the period of it's pulse using interrupt timers.
